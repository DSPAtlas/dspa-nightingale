## API Reference

### Attributes

#### `expanded: boolean (default: false)`

When `true` the children of the main track (if any), will be displayed. `false` indicates they should be hidden.

#### `"show-label": boolean (default: false)`

Set to `true` if a label should be rendered over each feature.

#### `label: string | null (default: null)`

Defines what to displays as label.

- If this is not set, but `show-label` is true, the component will render the `accession` of the feature as label.
- If is set, and starts with `"."` it will use its value as a selector in the feature object, for instance if `label=".feature.name"` it will try to get the value of `feature.name` for each particular feature, if the property doesn't exist, it won't render anything as label.
- If is set with a string that doesn't start with `"."` this string will be used as label.
