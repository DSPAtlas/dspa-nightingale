# HOW TO CREATE A BASIC COMPONENT (Hello World)

This document describes the creation of a basic Nightingale component.

## Steps to get a `Hello World` component.

1. Create the folder for your component under the `packages/` folder. This will ensure that the scripts defined in the main `package.json` can operate in the new component.
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello
   ```
2. Create a folder for your source code `src/` and one for your tests `test/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/src
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/tests
   ```
3. Create the `package.json` for the new component. Here is an example of its content:

   ```javascript
   {
     "name": "nightingale-hello",
     "version": "2.2.14",
     "description": "Basic usage",
     "files": [ "dist", "src" ],
     "main": "dist/index.js",
     "module": "dist/index.js",
     "type": "module",
     "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
     "scripts": {
        "build": "rollup --config ../../rollup.config.mjs"
      },
     "keywords": ["nightingale", "webcomponents", "customelements"],
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale.git"
     },
     "bugs": {
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale/issues"
     },
     "homepage": "https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/",
     "dependencies": {
      "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core": "^4.0.0",
      "d3": "7.8.2",
    }
   }

   ```

4. Create the entrypoint for webpack. The current setup of the nightingale project, looks for `src/index.ts`:

   ```javascript
   import NightingaleHello from "./nightingale-hello";

   export default NightingaleHello;
   ```

5. Create the file where the code of your custom element will be. In our example `src/nightingale-hello.ts`.

   1. To start we can create a Hello world document with this code:

      ```javascript
      import { LitElement, html } from "lit";
      import { customElement } from "lit/decorators.js";

      export
      @customElement("nightingale-hello")
      class NightingaleHello extends LitElement {
        @property({ type: String, attribute: "name" })
        name = "";

        render() {
          return html`<p>Hello ${this.name}!</p>`;
        }
      }

      export default NightingaleHello;
      ```

      Here are some notes of this code:

      - The library used to build the web components in Nightingale is [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/).
      - The `@customElement` decorator is used for defining the custom element following the web component standard of defining and registering the custom elements.
      - The component rendering is defined by the method `render()`.

   2. The above example inherits from [LitElement](https://lit.dev/docs/api/LitElement/), while there is a base element for any Nightingale component `nightingaleElement`.
      
      It is the base element for any Nightingale component which extends the LitElement itself. Any logic that should be shared among all the components are included here.
      Currently the only thing is doing, is setting the render root of the components in the element itself, instead of shadowDOM, the Lit element default.

      ```js
      import NightingaleElement from "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core";
      ```

    3. Event Handling
    4. Mixins ?
  6. Add in storybook

    ```
