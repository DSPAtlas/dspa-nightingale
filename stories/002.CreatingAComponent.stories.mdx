# HOW TO CREATE A BASIC COMPONENT (Hello World)

This document describes the creation of a basic Nightingale component.

## Steps to get a `Hello World` component.

1. Create the folder for your component under the `packages/` folder. This will ensure that the scripts defined in the main `package.json` can operate in the new component.
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello
   ```
2. Create a folder for your source code `src/` and one for your tests `test/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/src
   mkdir packages/nightingale-hello/tests
   ```
3. Create the `package.json` for the new component. Here is an example of its content:

   ```javascript
   {
     "name": "nightingale-hello",
     "version": "2.2.14",
     "description": "Basic usage",
     "files": [ "dist", "src" ],
     "main": "dist/index.js",
     "module": "dist/index.js",
     "type": "module",
     "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
     "scripts": {
        "build": "rollup --config ../../rollup.config.mjs"
      },
     "keywords": ["nightingale", "webcomponents", "customelements"],
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale.git"
     },
     "bugs": {
       "url": "https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/nightingale/issues"
     },
     "homepage": "https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/",
     "dependencies": {
      "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core": "^4.0.0",
      "d3": "7.8.2",
    }
   }

   ```

4. Create the entrypoint for webpack. The current setup of the nightingale project, looks for `src/index.ts`:

   ```javascript
   import NightingaleHello from "./nightingale-hello";

   export default NightingaleHello;
   ```

5. Create the file where the code of your custom element will be. In our example `src/nightingale-hello.ts`.

   1. To start we can create a Hello world document with this code:

      ```javascript
      import { LitElement, html } from "lit";
      import { customElement } from "lit/decorators.js";

      export
      @customElement("nightingale-hello")
      class NightingaleHello extends LitElement {
        @property({ type: String, attribute: "name" })
        name = "";

        render() {
          return html`<p>Hello ${this.name}!</p>`;
        }
      }

      export default NightingaleHello;
      ```

      Here are some notes of this code:

      - The library used to build the web components in Nightingale is [Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/).
      - The `@customElement` decorator is used for defining the custom element following the web component standard of defining and registering the custom elements.
      - The component rendering is defined by the method `render()`.

   2. The above example inherits from [LitElement](https://lit.dev/docs/api/LitElement/), while there is a base element for any Nightingale component `nightingaleElement`.
      
      It extends the LitElement itself. Any logic that should be shared among all the components are included in it as a `mixin`.
      Currently the only thing is doing, is setting the render root of the components in the element itself, instead of shadowDOM, the Lit element default.

      ```js
      import NightingaleElement from "@nightingale-elements/nightingale-new-core";
      ```

    3. Event Handling

      If the new component needs to fire events, it has to be of type change and the detail object should contain the attributes `type` and `value`.

      ```html
      <nightingale-manager reflected-attributes="attr1 attr2">
        <nightingale-hello attr1="X" attr2="Y" />
      </nightingale-manager>
      ```

      Here is an example of how the child component should fire the event:

      ```js
      this.dispatchEvent(
        new CustomEvent("change", {
          detail: {
            value: "New value",
            type: "attr1",
          },
        })
      );
      ```

  6. Let `yarn` and `lerna` know about your new component by making them.
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
  7. To view it in the showcase application, create `NightingaleHello.stories.ts` in `stories/` folder. The following command runs the application locally. 
    ```bash
    yarn storybook
    ```
 ```
